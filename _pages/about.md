I am a PhD student in [CIS](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Hinrich Sch√ºtze](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/schuetze/).
During my PhD, I interned at [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) working on open-domain question answering models.
My research interests are low-resource language processing, multilingual NLP, representation learning, question answering, and machine translation.

Prior to LMU, I received my master's degree in Computer Engineering at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), and my bachelor's degree at [IUST](http://ce-inter.iust.ac.ir/).
I have done an internship at [MT group at FBK](https://ict.fbk.eu/units/hlt-mt/) during my master's, and had the priviledge of working with [Marco Turchi](https://marcoturchi.com/) and [Matteo Negri](https://ict.fbk.eu/people/detail/matteo-negri/).


I'm happy to talk about research, and my work. If you have any questions about one of my papers, or my overall research, feel free to reach out!
