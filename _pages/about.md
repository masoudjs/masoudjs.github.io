 I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Hinrich Sch√ºtze. My research interests are low-resource language processing, multilingual NLP, representation learning, and machine translation.

Prior to LMU, I received my master's degree in Computer Engineering at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), and my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at [IUST](http://ce-inter.iust.ac.ir/).
